          Heyoooo! Welcome! My name is Jon Major Condon. I'm a Creative based in
          Wisconsin. I am a full-time Software Engineer, and I make stories
          through the art of photography and cinematography! I absolutley love
          bringing people joy through cinematic pieces of art, be that through
          Film or Photography!
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also been a Software Engineer for almost a decade! Within this
          time, I've been creatively solving technical problems, and have worn
          many hats within all shapes/sizes of companies helping them succeed
          alongside my peers.
